A didactic Web application written in Python to illustrate how to use
the http://bottlepy.org/[Bottle] web-framework with the
http://www.mongodb.org[MongoDB] database.

It's a port I made of Mike Dirolf's
https://github.com/mdirolf/djanMon[DjanMon] application (how to use
Django with MongoDB).

http://bottlepy.org/[Bottle] is a wonderful micro web-framework, it's
beautifully written and documented and has that ``just right'' feel
about it.  Bottle has support for multiple webservers and template
engines -- I'm really enjoying it after working with Django.

http://www.mongodb.org[MongoDB] is a schemaless document-oriented
database designed for the Web.  For me, working with MongoDB has been
a revelation. Database creation, administration and migration (long
the bane of database developers) is trivial in comparison with
traditional SQL databases.  Document storage management is baked into
MongoDB and is used in many web applications (document storage has
always been awkward and slow with relational databases).

To run the application install the <<X1,prerequisite packages>> then:

  git clone https://github.com/srackham/bottle-mongodb-example.git
  cd bottle-mongodb-example
  python bottle-mongodb-example.py

The application creates and displays a paged list of user
created messages which are stored in a MongoDB database along with
uploaded images (no file system management required it's all in the
database) -- not bad for 93 lines of Python code and a 79 line
HTML template.  The really neat thing is that you don't have to create
the database, tables or schema -- it all happens automatically.


[[X1]]
== Prerequisites
- Python.
- MongoDB (see the http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] website for
  install instructions).
- PyMongo, the Python MongoDB driver:

  sudo easy_install pymongo

- The Bottle web-framework:

  git clone https://github.com/defnull/bottle.git
  cd bottle
  python setup.py install

I'm running in this environment -- it works for me but your mileage
may vary:

- Xubuntu 10.04
- Bottle 0.9dev
- Python 2.6.5
- MongoDB 1.6.5
- PyMongo 1.9
